# SOLUWISE CODE CHALLENGE 

## About 
This code was written in PERL and it simply reads and analyzes a test XML file and creates an HTML file containing tables with the data analyzed. 
The XML file is copy/paste from the source code found [here](http://cinecl.soluwise.com/plaza_las_americas.html). 

#### What it Does
The XML file (test.xml) contains information about Movies with the show-time and show-date of each one. The PERL file (index.pl) creates an HTML file (movies.html) that displays that data in tables.
